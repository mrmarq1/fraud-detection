# Fraud Detection Project [New - Ongoing Project]

Using an artificial fraud dataset, this project aims to produce a performant classifier capable of handling severe class imbalances whilst, critically, maintaining the model transparency necessary for such a use case. The project will begin with a conventional and comprehensive approach to modelling before exploring Bayesian probabilistic algorithms via pymc. By leveraging Bayesian modelling the project hopes to gain from the incorporation of prior beliefs, strong model interpretability and the ability to express the level of uncertainty in the model's parameters.
